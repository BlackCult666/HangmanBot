# HangmanBot
An inline telegram bot to play Hangman Game made in Kotlin. 

The original idea came from my friend SuperMarcomen (https://github.com/SuperMarcomen), which first created the bot.
Over time a joke challenge arose between us and I decided to recreate it in kotlin to show him my brutal power.

However, as I've just said, despite the fact that the code is mine, all the rights about the bot's concept, messages and design belong to him.
